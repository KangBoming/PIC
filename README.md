# PIC:Protein Importance Calculator
PIC is a sequence-based model for multi-level essential protein prediction. PIC utilizes a pre-trained protein language model to extract sequence features. Then, we add a multi-head self-attention layer to capture the relative importance of amino acids at different positions. Finally, a multi-layer perceptron is used to predict essential proteins.

The PIC web server for comprehensive prediction and analysis of the essentiality of human proteins is now available at http://www.cuilab.cn/
